The special session on "Polytopes-Algebra-Computation",
in the context of Applications of Computer Algebra - ACA 2021,
will focus on the interaction of polyhedral geometry with algebra and algebraic geometry from a computational viewpoint.

Topics of interest
-------------------

Everything in the intersection of polyhedral geometry, algebraic geometry and algorithms, including but not limited to:
- Polytopes in algebra and algebraic geometry
- Newton polytopes
- Computational Ehrhart theory
- Algebraic aspects of polytopes
- Algebraic applications of computational geometry
- Applications of Polytopes (e.g., statistics, combinatorics etc.)
- Software - Normaliz, polymake, 4ti2, barvinok, gfan, LattE, etc.

Participants
-------------

- Winfried Bruns - Normaliz meets Lawrence: polytope volume by signed decomposition
- Carles Checa - Tropical refinement
- Antonio Macchia - Slack realization spaces and realizability of polytopes
- Cihan Okay -  A hidden variable model for universal quantum computation with magic states on qubits
