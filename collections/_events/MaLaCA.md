The special session on "Machine Learning and Computer Algebra",
in the context of Applications of Computer Algebra - ACA 2021,
will focus on the interaction between machine learning and computer algebra.
Both on ways computer algebra is used in machine learning and on how machine learning
can assist with computer algebra problems.
One of the goals of this session is to start the discussion for a systematic program
for combining machine learning and computer algebra techniques.

Topics of interest
-------------------

Everything in the intersection of machine learning with computer algebra, including but not limited to:
- using ML for solving algebraic problems
- using ML for improving algebraic algorithms and tools
- using computer algebra to assist computations in ML
- algebraic problems adequate for ML  
- experimental studies of interactions between ML and CA
- Related software tools

Call for contribution
-----------------------

You are welcome to submit short abstracts on topics related to the topics of MaLaCA.
The submission is done via email to [Zafeirakis Zafeirakopoulos](mailto:zafeirakopoulos@gmail.com).
