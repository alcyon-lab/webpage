Compute the full generating function of the solid partitions on a cube.
The problem has a long history, since P. MacMahon more than 100 years ago investigated it.

Theoretically the problem is easy to understand.
Computationally is intractable by current software and methods.

In this project we study structural properties that can speed up the implementation
as well as using parallel computing for making the computation possible.
