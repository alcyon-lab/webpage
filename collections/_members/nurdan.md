 I received my master's and bacherlor's degree in Mathematics at Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University. In the last year of my undergraduate education, I studied on Heegaard splittings with my advisor Mustafa Topkara. My master thesis's advisors are Özer Öztürk and Zafeirakis Zafeirakopoulos. In my master thesis, I have worked on topics such as toric varieties, algebraic combinatorics, intersection theory and Ehrhart theory. Also, I am in TUBITAK 3501-Project, HALYCON (Heterogeneous Algorithms for Combinatorics, Geometry, Optimization and Number Theory).
