I am a mathematician spending most of my time designing or implementing algorithms.
I hold a Ptychion (4-year degree) in Mathematics and an MSc. in Computational Science from the University of Athens. I was awarded a PhD from the Johannes Kepler University in Linz, under the supervision of Prof. Paule (Research Institute for Symbolic Computation - RISC, Austria) and Prof. Matthias Beck (San Francisco State University, USA). After that, I held post-doctoral positions at RISC, ΕρΓΑ and Galatasaray University. Currently I am at the Institute of Information Technologies of Gebze Technical University.
