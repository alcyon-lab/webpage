<p>In ALCYON (Algorithms for Combinatorics, Geometry, Optimization and Number Theory) we work on Symbolic Computation. Both on the mathematics to improve algorithms and on the efficient (high performance) implementations of algorithms in order to push mathematics further.
Symbolic Computation lies in the intersection of mathematics and computer science. This means that it is both 100% mathematics and 100% computer science.
